                    <p>Frogs are the only remaining amphibians in Australia. Frog eggs are mainly laid in water
                        and their larval stage as tadpoles have developed tails and internal gills adapted to life underwater.
                        As they mature into adult frogs, they develop lungs and live in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.
                        Frogs play a key role in many food webs, both as predators and as prey. 
                        Because of their intermediate position in food webs, their permeable skin and biphasic lives
                        (living in water and on land), frogs are a good ecological indicator of the environment.
                        By observing frog populations, we can get a good indication of ecosystem health as frogs are sensitive to environmental change.
                        
                        Habitat loss, climate change and pollution are large causes of declining frog populations around the world.
                        Frog populations in Australia are declining at an alarming rate.</p>
